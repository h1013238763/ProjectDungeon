  - Ah {Player}, you have returned alive and well! I knew I had faith in you! Tell
    me, just what did you discover in the depths of this dungeon?
  - Your Majesty, while exploring the ever dangerous dungeon, I stumbled upon a hidden
    room which then I  found an ancient tome. The secrets and information it may
    contain, It could very much benefit the kingdom!
  - Why this is excellent news! Hand it over, so that I may take a better look at
    this tome! With what you have found, you shall be rewarded generously.
  - "You hand the tome to the King, and watch with concern as when he opens the tome,
    he too experiences the visions and power you felt when you touched the tome.
    The King, whose expression was of a joyous and friendly King, turns to a grimness
    and malice as his once gleaming blue eyes darken\u2026"
  - "(coldly) I must apologize adventurer\u2026But with this new revelation, this
    new discovery, this changes everything. Do you realize just HOW MUCH power this
    tome has? This tome has the ability to change the balance of powers of the kingdoms
    across the realm! I can\u2019t risk a pawn with knowledge too dangerous for a
    commoner to run loose. Arch Priests please, dispose of this \"hero\" to a place
    of no return."
  - "(as the teleportation spell begins) No No No No! You can\u2019t do this to me!
    The sacrifice I made to get this to you! I won\u2019t let you get away with this!"
  - (Smirking) Im Sorry adventurer, but I'm afraid this is where your story must
    end!
