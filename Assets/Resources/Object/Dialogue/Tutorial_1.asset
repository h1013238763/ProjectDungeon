  - '{Player} it is then? A wonderful name indeed and It is good to meet you formally.
    Now let''s get down to the matter at hand.'
  - As you know, a new dungeon has been discovered, shrouded in mystery. I would
    normally send in my troops, but this dungeon seems to be more complex and dangerous
    than normal, which is why I delegated that we obtain you and your expertise to
    help us with this endeavor. I want you to explore its depths and report back
    with any findings. This mission is not without danger, but I believe you are
    up to the challenge.
  - "Of courseI accept, Your Majesty. I\u2019ll prepare myself and venture into this
    dungeon and bring back whatever secrets lie within."
  - You have my gratitude. May you return victorious. And May Atherius be with you.
