  - "Where am I? The edge of an endless canyon? By the will of Atherius, I'm alive,
    but all of my gear was lost to the canyon\u2026"
  - A fall like that would have been the end of me. I need to find my way back, and
    I need to make the King pay for this betrayal and stop him!
  - Why this is excellent news! Hand it over, so that I may take a better look at
    this tome! With what you have found, you shall be rewarded generously.
  - "I may have been stripped of everything, but I\u2019ll be damned if I let this
    be the end of my story! The Righteous King will regret wronging me to this degree!"
  - I'm going to uncover the truth behind this tome or die trying and make the King
    answer for his betrayal! I will have a ways to go and the journey ahead will
    definitely be difficult, but I am no stranger to danger, for I am {Player}!
