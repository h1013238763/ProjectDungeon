  character_lines:
  - It is the Third Era of The Lands of Eldor, in the year 433. The realm, teeming
    with magic and mystery, now bears the scars of centuries past. Kingdoms stand
    as testament to the victories and defeats etched into their very stone walls.
  - In this age of uncertainty, you, a simple adventurer, navigate the wondrous lands
    of Eldor's landscapes to explore the many dungeons that lie all around, waiting
    to be explored. Born as a humble villager and wanting to see more of the world
    outside the confines of your village, your life has been woven with the threads
    of exploration and survival. Dungeon clearing quests were your livelihood, a
    routine that shaped your days until destiny knocked at your door.
  - As an average denizen of Eldor, you have heard rumors all around the tales of
    ancient artifacts and hidden realms, oblivious to the power play that unfolded
    among the ruling royalty. Little did you know that your journey was destined
    to follow a different route than living the rest of your day's dungeon crawling
    for a living, thrusting you into the heart of political complexities and betrayal.
  - "As you are in the guild hall with the air thick with the scent of anticipation
    and adventure, you are browsing the jobs posted on the job board. But then a
    growing murmur captures your curiosity. A crowd of adventurers gather. Intrigued,
    you follow the gaze of your fellow adventurers, their eyes fixed on the newest
    job posting, embroiled in golden text. This is a job straight from the Royal
    Kingdom\u2026"
  - In the midst of the guild's vibrant activity, you find the center of attention
    shifting towards a figure who stands apart, a messenger draped in the regalia
    of the royal kingdom. The messenger bearing the sigil of the Righteous King,
    unfolds a parchment that commands attention.
  - (loudly, addressing the adventurers) Hear ye, Hear ye! By the decree of the Righteous
    King, King Almaric VII himself, a new dungeon has been discovered, its secrets
    awaiting to be discovered by only the greatest and most seasoned of Dungeon Adventurers.
    The one selected for this noble task, shall come forth and embark on a journey
    that will be etched into the annals of Eldor's history!
  - "As the messenger\u2019s revelation ripples through the guild hall, the adventurers'
    gazes turn toward you as out of anyone there, there was no one as seasoned and
    experienced in Dungeon Crawling than you. The messenger's eyes meet yours, and
    in that moment, a shared understanding unfolds.The crowd watches in hushed anticipation,
    their eyes awaiting your decision, as the weight of destiny descends upon your
    shoulders."
  - Welcome, brave adventurer! As you may have found out by my messenger, I have
    a task of utmost importance for someone of your caliber.
  - It truly is an honor your Majesty, I am at your service.
  - May I ask, young one, what is your name?
