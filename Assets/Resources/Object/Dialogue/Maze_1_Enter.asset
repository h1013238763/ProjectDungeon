  - 'After you regain your bearings and find out where you are, you traverse the
    canyon desert.

    Sand as far as the eye can see. But eventually you stumble
    upon the entrance to a dungeon!'
  - As you look around you luckily find a simple old weapon next to a skeleton of
    a past dungeon crawler.
  - "This must be the entrance to the Desert Dungeon. I better tread carefully, all
    I have is ____ \r\n(whatever you make the player have as their first weapon)
    and I've got a feeling this dungeon \r\nhas more than its fair share of danger."
  - 'As the sands shift from the desert winds outside, you traverse deeper into the
    dungeon,

    listening to various sounds of creatures that are lurking within.
    Now is the time to explore.'
