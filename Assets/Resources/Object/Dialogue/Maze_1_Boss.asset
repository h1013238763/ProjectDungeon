  - "So, you're the one behind all the chaos in my Dungeon. \rWho dares to disturb
    the sands?"
  - "I'm here to put an end to you demon. \rThe desert should be a place left to
    nature, not a playground for evil like you.\r You will only be my stepping stone
    to my goal!"
  - "Humans. Always meddling in things beyond their understanding. \rVery well,enter
    my domain, and you will see now how you shall face the consequences."
  - "I've faced demons before, and I've sent them back to whatever abyss they crawled
    out of. \r\nYou won't be an exception."
  - "You are bold, mortal, but your arrogance will be your downfall. \rThe sands
    will consume you, and your name will be forgotten in the howling winds of eternity."
  - "We'll see about that. I've come prepared to face whatever you throw at me. \rTime
    to end this and put an end your evil."
  - "Your determination is commendable, but determination alone won't save you. \n"
  - "\rBehold the true power of the desert, and despair as I unleash the fury of
    the desert winds upon your\r brittle soul!\r"
